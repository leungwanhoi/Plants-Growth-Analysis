# Analysis of the Growth of Plants Watered by Different Kinds of Solutions

## Introduction
Vegetables play an important role in our diet. It provides dietary fiber, minerals and vitamins which are necessary for us to maintain health. Nowadays people pay more attention to maintaining health, the quality of vegetables are therefore becoming a serious issue. As a result, agricultural chemicals are concerned more frequently.
To solve this problem, kitchen gardens where people grow their own vegetables at home become popular. Since they can control the amount of agricultural chemicals, the quality of vegetables is guaranteed. However, with limited living areas in Hong Kong, kitchen gardens are not possible for most of the families in Hong Kong. Instead, hydroponics, a method of growing plants without soil which requires less space, is more suitable for families in Hong Kong.
Quality of water is one of the major factors in hydroponics. Therefore, we are interested in the effect on plants of using different solutions. To figure it out, we carried out this study to find out the difference in growing plants by using different solutions.
